## Reflection

NoSQL database has become popular and simpler to use than relational database. This project aimed to familiarise with NoSQL database. Despite numerous NoSQL databases options out there, AWS DynamoDB was specifically chosen so that it aids my learning in taking the AWS certifications.

The challenging aspect of this project is having a different approach to database design. In relational database, designs have to take into account of relationships with the data and conform to normalisation rules. However, for NoSQL databases, it takes more of an application-centric approach, concerning with how the application will query data.
